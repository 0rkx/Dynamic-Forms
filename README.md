# Dynamic Forms with GPT-3
*For now*  this repository contains a Python script that implements a product review survey using OpenAI's ChatGPT language model. The survey asks users to rate a product on a scale of 1 to 5 and then uses ChatGPT to ask follow-up questions based on the user's response. 

### **How to Use**
To run the product review survey, you will need to have an OpenAI API key. You can sign up for a key and find more information on the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys "OpenAI website").

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the openai Python package by running pip install openai in your terminal.
- Replace the YOUR_API_KEY placeholder in the main.py file with your OpenAI API key.
- Run the product_review_survey.py script by running python main.py in your terminal.



## Future Goals
- Develop a database to store survey responses in the command-line version of the application. This will enable users to store and retrieve responses to survey questions, making it easier to analyze data over time.

- Implement a user-friendly display mechanism for survey responses within the command-line version of the application. This will enable users to view survey results in an easily understandable format.

- Implement dynamic initial prompts within the command-line version of the application. This will enable the survey to be tailored to the specific product being reviewed or the specific survey being conducted.

- Develop a mechanism to automatically end a conversation when the application determines that it is unable to continue the conversation in a productive manner. This will reduce the amount of time users spend on unproductive or irrelevant conversations.

- Develop a website-based interface for the survey application, migrating functionality from the command-line version to a web-based format. This will enable users to access the survey from any device with an internet connection, improving accessibility and convenience.

- Implement a graphical display mechanism for survey responses within the web-based interface. This will make it easier for users to visualize and analyze survey data.
